# Usque implementation progress

This is the Windows and Android / Android TV checklist. macOS source is kept for later work and is not built, packaged, or tested for the current release.

A checked item means the code is in the tree and its current automated tests pass. An unchecked item is unfinished, or only valid in an isolated environment that CI does not run.

Desktop UI and engine remain unprivileged. The desktop agent accepts only versioned, authenticated operations for TUN, routes, DNS, firewall state, and system proxy state. Android hosts the Rust `cdylib` inside the dedicated `:vpn` process.

- [x] Implement a persistent Windows Filtering Platform Kill Switch and fail-closed Agent/Engine reattachment after either process restarts.
- [x] Add Agent protocol v3 physical-DNS snapshots and reference-counted, pipe-leased exact WFP permits so Windows TUN can route GeoSite/GeoIP hits directly without a broad Engine egress rule.
- [x] Run bounded UDP/TCP Split DNS at `198.18.0.1` / `fd00::1`, classify QNAME before upstream selection, retry truncated UDP over TCP, and cache only question-reachable A/AAAA hints.
- [x] Credential Manager vault backend for all identity record types.

  directory, a default-off current-user data purge choice, exact
  Wintun/signature validation, Agent service installation, and fatal
  uninstall/upgrade recovery sequencing.
- [x] Remove crash-surviving Usque Wintun devices by journaled name/GUID/LUID,
  distinguish true uninstall from major upgrade, and delete only proven-clean
  machine recovery state before MSI removes the Agent binary.

- [ ] Isolated clean-install, upgrade, and uninstall validation.

### Android and Android TV

- [x] API 26 minimum, TV Leanback entry, and non-touchscreen compatibility.

- [x] Implement `VpnService.Builder` address/DNS setup, API 26–32 CIDR complements, API 33+ exclusions, a 256-route ceiling, retained TUN reconnects, `protect(fd)`, and underlying-network rebinding.
- [x] Terminate GeoIP- or GeoSite-hint-selected Android TUN TCP/UDP flows in a bounded userspace gateway and relay them through protected sockets bound to the selected physical network.
- [x] Snapshot Android `LinkProperties.dnsServers`, publish internal Split DNS routes, and fail VPN startup if a valid physical DNS path is unavailable.
- [x] Add device-scoped Android per-app proxy (include-only `addAllowedApplication`) stored in app settings, not the Profile.
- [x] Fail-closed Android reconnect: retain the TUN fd when Kill Switch is armed and the address/DNS/MTU/route identity is unchanged; establish a replacement TUN before closing the old one when that identity changes.
- [x] Expose Android start-on-boot, Quick Settings tile request, and a deep link to system Always-on VPN settings.
- [ ] Sleep, network-switch, and TV lifecycle tests.

- [x] Make versioned Rust configuration the authoritative Profile store on Windows and Android, then remove the migrated Flutter draft.
- [x] Connect desktop and Android identity provisioning to their platform vaults.
- [x] Add Windows manual Zero Trust callback entry and an Android process-local, same-team, single-consumption protocol callback.

- [x] Honor profile `auto_connect` once at process start (and Android boot when start-on-boot is also on).
- [x] Replace controlled reconnects with true no-drop frontend hot mutation while retaining the same MASQUE channel.
- [x] Fetch fixed-version `flag-icons` SVG through the active tunnel, validate it, cache it, and return SVG bytes to Flutter.
- [x] Add diagnostics content review plus Windows and Android native save pickers; exported bundles contain bounded sanitized summaries and logs.
- [x] Add manual and rate-limited automatic GitHub release checks without automatic installation.
- [x] Add the direct-country rule download/update/search panel, cached-state gating, partial-result feedback, and accessible enable controls.
- [x] Add privacy-filtered 7-day/20-MiB JSON log rotation on Windows and Android.
- [x] Add widget tests for Simplified Chinese dark mode at 200% scaling and Android TV D-pad navigation.

## Milestone 5 — release hardening

- [x] Add an exact-candidate H3/H2 endpoint and independent IPv4, IPv6, DNS, Kill Switch, route, and direct-rule observer gate.
- [x] Add a protected Windows snapshot-VM matrix for clean install, upgrade, connected uninstall, Engine/Agent failure, sleep/network change, platform-state restoration, and Wintun residue.
- [x] Add a protected Android physical-device matrix for network changes, airplane mode, Doze, process reclamation, Always-on, Lockdown, reboot, upgrade, and TV lifecycle.
- [x] Add an optional controlled seven-sample performance baseline and protected evidence report without making runner availability a publication prerequisite.
- [ ] Define enforced throughput, latency, and memory thresholds versus the Go oracle (wish targets: throughput >= 90%, p95 latency regression <= 10%, memory <= 125%). The optional baseline records and validates evidence but does not encode these numeric acceptance targets.
- [x] Stable signing identities and published fingerprints.
- [x] The protected stable tag workflow builds every declared package from `main`.
- [x] SHA-256, SPDX SBOM attestations, provenance, commit, and certificate fingerprint.
- [ ] Expand clean-machine installation and removal coverage beyond the current protected matrix to every supported artifact and OS/architecture combination.

The release workflow fails if a Windows or Android artifact, signing input,
architecture check, required CI result, manifest, SBOM, attestation, protected
runner report, or matching evidence is missing, failed, `not_run`, or bound to
the wrong candidate. A local binary cannot replace a failed GitHub Actions
artifact. The current protected matrix is mandatory; broader per-artifact
clean-machine coverage and numeric Go-oracle performance thresholds remain open.

How the current stable tag is built and published is in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).
