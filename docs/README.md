# Documentation / 文档导航

Choose a guide by task. Technical documents are mainly in English; the product
overview is available in [English](../README.md) and
[简体中文](../README.zh-CN.md).

按任务选择文档。开发分支可能包含尚未发布的行为；使用正式安装包时，请查阅对应
Release 的说明及标签下文档。历史验收记录只适用于其注明的提交，不代表当前版本
已经通过相同测试。

Use these pages when changing an implementation. Keep behavior descriptions in
sync with executable sources, preserve protobuf numbers and invariant identifiers,
and retain fail-closed checks. Scoped reviews identify the version they examined;
they do not establish performance or leak results for later versions.

Common terms in these references:

| Term | Meaning / 含义 |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime Profile | The connection's account identity and effective settings; shared network preferences are not per-account settings / 连接使用的账号身份和设置副本；共享网络设置不属于单个账号 |
| Data plane | The mechanism carrying application traffic, such as CONNECT-IP or L4 / 承载应用流量的方式，例如 CONNECT-IP 或 L4 |
| Generation / epoch | A version of network, session or process state, used to reject results from an older state / 网络、会话或进程状态的版本号，用于拒绝旧状态返回的结果 |
| Lease | Tracked ownership of a resource or permission that must be released or recovered / 需要释放或恢复的资源使用权 |
| Fail closed | Refuse an operation or traffic when its safety conditions cannot be confirmed / 无法确认安全条件时拒绝操作或流量 |

## Historical records / 历史记录

| Record | Scope / 范围 |
| --- | --- |
| [Implementation baseline](implementation-baseline.md) | PR-00 source, toolchain, and unavailable-lab baseline / PR-00 基线 |
| [Network-quality acceptance](network-quality-acceptance.md) | PR-01–PR-12 implementation and test matrix, with later correction notice / 阶段验收及后续更正 |
| [PMTU review and fixes](pmtu-path-fixes.md) | Candidate-specific defects, corrections, and regression results / 特定候选版本的修复记录 |
| [Receive-buffer experiments](RECEIVE_BUFFER_EXPERIMENTS.md) | Retired Android A/B builds and production-default validation / 已结束的安卓对照试验与默认值验证记录 |
| [Initial L4 validation](L4_VALIDATION.md) | Initial implementation checks and unavailable environments / 初始实现检查与未运行项目 |
| [L4 backpressure fix](L4_BACKPRESSURE_FIX.md) | Reproduced stalls, stop handling and regression results / 阻塞复现、停止处理与回归结果 |
| [L4 download optimization](L4_DOWNLOAD_OPTIMIZATION.md) | Copy/allocation changes and their original measurements / 拷贝、分配优化及当时的检查记录 |
| [VPN Gate validation](VPN_GATE_VALIDATION.md) | Local implementation and follow-up checks / 本地实现与后续修复检查 |

Historical results apply only to the recorded candidate and environment. Some
records identify a baseline plus uncommitted work rather than a reproducible
source snapshot; those limits are stated in the record. Keep the original test
counts and `not_run` statuses. Record later runs separately with their exact
candidate and environment.

## Upstream references / 上游资料

The [sanitized fixtures](../oracle/fixtures/README.md) explain the interoperability
inputs. The [Go README](../oracle/go/README.md) and
[research notes](../oracle/go/RESEARCH.md) belong to the frozen upstream client,
not this GUI product; their CLI commands and platform claims do not define
Usque app behavior.

Third-party source and license notices remain with their components. Local
changes are recorded separately for
[quiche](../third_party/quiche-0.29.3/USQUE-PATCH.md),
[boring-sys](../third_party/boring-sys-4.22.0/USQUE-PATCH.md),
[smoltcp integration](../third_party/ts_netstack_smoltcp_core/PATCHES.md), and
[Wintun provenance](../third_party/wintun-0.14.1/SOURCE.md).
Do not rewrite frozen upstream documents as product instructions.
