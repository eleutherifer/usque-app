# Experimental Cloudflare Zero Trust enrollment

Usque can experimentally register a new profile with a Cloudflare Zero Trust organization on Windows and Android. This feature is intentionally narrower than the Cloudflare One Client: it uses the organization account to create a persistent device identity, then carries Internet traffic through Usque's existing MASQUE tunnel.

It does not implement organization policy synchronization, device posture, managed DNS, Split Tunnels, private-network routing, WARP-to-WARP, service-token enrollment, or automatic client-session reauthentication. The Android per-app proxy picker is a local UID filter on this device; it is not Cloudflare One Split Tunnel or organization policy sync. Gateway policy can still affect traffic on Cloudflare's side, but Usque does not claim full Cloudflare One Client compatibility.

## Enrollment flow

1. Create a profile and select **Cloudflare Zero Trust (Experimental)**.
2. Enter the organization's single-label team name.
3. Accept the existing Cloudflare terms and open `https://<team>.cloudflareaccess.com/warp` in the system browser.
4. Complete the organization's Access/IdP login.
5. After Access login, return to Usque. Android may show an app chooser if the official WARP client is also installed. On Windows, paste the complete `com.cloudflare.warp://.../auth?token=...` callback or fill it from the clipboard. If you opted in to the current-user protocol association and Usque is already running, Windows can forward that callback to the open window. Manual paste remains available on both platforms.
6. Usque exchanges the one-time assertion for a device ID/token and P-256 MASQUE enrollment, validates the returned enrollment endpoint contract, and commits the identity and profile atomically. The returned IPv4 and IPv6 endpoint addresses are stored on the Zero Trust account and cannot be edited. Port and SNI remain editable device-wide settings, initially `443` and `speed.cloudflare.com`.

The Access assertion is never written to the profile, vault, Android saved state, or logs. It is bounded to 64 KiB, accepted only for the expected team and exact callback shape, held in memory, consumed once, and discarded after submission. A restarted Android process has no active login and rejects the callback.

## Identity boundaries

- Consumer profiles cannot be converted to Zero Trust profiles.
- A Zero Trust profile can sign in again only to the same organization. This refreshes its device registration, credentials, and registration-owned IPv4/IPv6 endpoint addresses without replacing the shared port or SNI. Credential replacement is journaled so an interrupted local commit restores the previous credentials and address pair on the next startup.
- Provider and organization are mirrored in a versioned, non-secret profile binding. The vault metadata must match it; missing or conflicting metadata is invalid and may only be repaired by signing in to the bound organization. Unbound pre-feature profiles remain legacy Consumer identities.
- Zero Trust IPv4/IPv6 endpoint addresses come only from registration and are account-specific. Port and SNI are device-wide settings shared by Consumer and Zero Trust profiles; editing or resetting either from any account updates every profile. Upgrading a legacy or schema-10 configuration keeps the historical registered address pair while moving port and SNI to the shared values. An experimental schema-11 build recovers the pair from its preserved migration backup when possible; without recoverable data the identity is marked invalid and must sign in again instead of silently using Consumer addresses.
- Zero Trust profiles have no Usque WARP License operation. License copy, bind/unbind, and WARP Secret export are hidden and rejected by the engine.
- Deleting a profile removes only local credentials. It does not revoke the device registration in the organization dashboard; an administrator must remove residual or test registrations there.
- Registration never falls back to a Consumer identity after a Zero Trust failure.

## Platform behavior

Windows does not change the default MSI tables and does not register `com.cloudflare.warp` at install time. Paste and clipboard fill always work. An optional, default-off Settings toggle can create a current-user HKCU protocol association that points at this Usque executable. Turning the option off deletes that association only when the open command already points at this executable; it does not remove a handler owned by official WARP or another app. If official WARP is installed, leaving the option off keeps WARP as the user-visible handler. The first Usque window remains the single UI instance: a later launch with a callback URI restores that window, forwards the URI, and exits.

Android declares a restricted browsable intent for `com.cloudflare.warp://*.cloudflareaccess.com/auth`. An in-memory login session additionally requires the exact expected team. `onCreate` and `onNewIntent` feed the same one-shot gate; callbacks without an active login, for another team, after cancellation, after process restart, or after the first accepted callback are discarded. Co-installation with the official WARP app is allowed to produce Android's normal app chooser. Windows uses the same scheme, host, path, and single-token checks before any registration request is sent.

Re-authenticating the connected profile disconnects the active tunnel before replacing credentials and registered endpoint addresses, then reconnects with the existing shared port/SNI settings.

## Release gate

The enrollment exchange and `zt-masque.cloudflareclient.com` contract are experimental. Do not describe or ship this feature as production-supported until a dedicated real organization passes all of the following:

- enrollment policy permits the test identity and does not require unsupported posture;
- the dashboard attributes the device to the expected user;
- the returned IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints remain in Cloudflare's documented Zero Trust ranges;
- H3, H2 fallback, IPv4, IPv6, endpoint-pin refresh, and restart reconnection work through SOCKS5/HTTP on Windows without starting Windows VPN mode or changing routes/DNS;
- Android VPN validation passes only on an isolated test device or emulator;
- the vault, logs, diagnostic bundle, profile JSON, and Android state contain no Access assertion;
- the administrator removes every test or orphaned registration afterward.

If live validation fails, stop the release. Do not silently fall back to Consumer registration or probe undocumented API variants.
